# Find New STT/Voice Projects

Search GitHub for new Linux STT and voice assistant projects that meet the inclusion criteria.

**Search strategy:**

1. **Use search terms** from the repo:
   - "linux stt"
   - "linux whisper"
   - "linux voice assistant"
   - "linux speech recognition"
   - "whisper gui linux"
   - "wayland stt"

2. **Filter results**:
   - Created or updated in last 12 months
   - Minimum 5 stars (to filter noise)
   - Must have Linux support
   - Meets inclusion criteria (post-Whisper era, not TTS)

3. **For each promising project**:
   - Check if already in README
   - Verify it meets inclusion criteria
   - Note key features and category

4. **Present findings** as:
   - Repository URL
   - Brief description
   - Suggested category
   - Star count and last activity
   - Notable features

5. **Prioritize projects** with:
   - Wayland support
   - High star counts
   - Recent activity
   - Novel approaches

Present 5-10 top candidates for review before adding to README.
