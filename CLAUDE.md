This repository is a resource list of voice tools with Linux support.

This encompasses:

- Voice assistants 
- Real time transcription ("voice typing") 
- Note systems (async typing) 

For a voice tool to be accessible for a Linux desktop user (where desktop just means standard non-mobile hardware) it could be: 

- SaaS 
- Local GUI 
- Local CLI  
- Web UI - whether deplyoed locally or on a remote 

Transcription and voice support on Linux has traditionally been quite spotty and lately the marketing is truly blossoming! 

I created this repo for my own reference (to bookmark and check out projects when I have time). But it's open source / public.

## Our Workflow 

I will periodically share projects to add 

You can help by:

- Checking if they are already there 
- Categorising them if not 

Stargazer counts are useful insofar as they help guide towards projects with more traction. So the data needs to be updated periodically. 

As a Wayland user, I'm also particularly keen to highlight and note projects with Wayland support (where virtual input support is a bit tempermental!). I will highlight and add notes where appropriate

## My Notation 

I will provide repos to add with :

- Repo link 
- Notes 

And sometimes organise them by header with a brief description of what makes this a category. These should be integrated after improvement
